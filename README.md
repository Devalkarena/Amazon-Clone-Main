# Amazon-Clone-Main

## Introduction

This project is a front-end replica of Amazon's homepage, developed using **HTML** and **CSS**. It showcases my proficiency in creating structured and visually engaging web interfaces.

The layout closely mirrors the original Amazon interface, featuring a responsive navigation bar, product grids, and footer sections. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my front-end design capabilities and attention to detail.

You can explore the source code, contribute, or fork the project via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/amazon-homepage-clone).
